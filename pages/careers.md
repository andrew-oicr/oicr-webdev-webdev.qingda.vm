description: "We believe that software is a direct product of the cognitive processs of individuals engaged in intellect-intensive innovative teamwork, with procedures and teams designed to facilitate communication and coordination among team members engaged in closely coordinated, intellect-intensive work.  We work with a coordinated approach to deliver measurable results within a portfolio of software solutions, valuing and supporting knowledge productivity in our UX and Software Engineering knowledge and practices.  Our leadership enables us to handle the impractical with inclusion and objective quantification and measurement within its processes, methods, tools, program modules combined with data values, and combinations of input data required to operate, to communicate and to deliver.  Our understanding helps to define an operating platform technology, software embeded in infrastructure, within operation teams to manage constantly evolving and frequently updated knowledge using a continuous integration workflow to take changes by a team into live production. We appreciate what is done well vs. what is said well. "

  title: "Meaningful Outcomes"
  content: "The team has a successful history (>50+ students) in educating the brightest, most motivated students, and to provide those interested in science, systems design and software engineering with the knowledge, skills and experiences necessary to begin successful careers. The team's co-op term educates and prepares students with solid experiences will make them highly competitive.  The team has designed task-centered roles with training that will enable students to gain the lifelong learning skills, obtaining the practical knowledge and hands-on experiences needed for web development in whatever field.  The required on-boarding training for each major product development function of a solution provides the fundamentals and breadth; provides in-depth exploration of topics; provides relevant, practical experiences so the students will have opportunities to carry out projects, in which the students actually contribute to science and engineering projects."

projects:
  title: "Meaningful Skills"
  content: "It is widely recognized that students learn through hands-on experiences, and in these experiences, students work closely with team members to generate hypotheses, design and perform problem-solving.  And it is now widely recognized that employers are looking for students who have had experience doing actual design and codeing, working on real projects.  The team's approach is to help students learn how to perform tasks by experiencing it.  Tasks are typically performed in sandbox virtual computing environments with safe Git Repository copies of full systems, and this provides students with the skill sets needed to run full-stack systems to apply creativity with full-ownership. Tasks are applicable to anything online, using modern, online systems to create continuous integration towards higher quality and productivity. Feedback into the work processes is not only encouraged, it is part of the team's work process, to which students that learn will transfer this knowledge to new students during the end-of-term student-lead on-boarding training operation.  "

co-op:
  title: "Meaningful Experiences"
  content: "All tasks in our team are shared daily within team standups on an active Scrum. Students are not limited to reading about how to do tasks because the team needs and provides opportunities for students to explore methods and deliver solution deliverables.  Students can also take multiple roles, in which students will work with a senior full-time member for deeper dives into areas of interest. These mentoring opportunities can be designed to expand on and complement specific areas that meet the studentâ€™s learning and career goals. The team provides many opportunities to work with research teams, and international projects around the world that aid in producing meaningful outcomes. The team will work closely with individual students to identify opportunities that allow them to explore their interests and might include working directly with OICR teams who are actively conducting research, or participating in formal experiments, such as those supported by the Ontario's MRI; US's NIH; and UK's Sanger Wellcome Trust. The team also works in support from BioTalent Canada."
