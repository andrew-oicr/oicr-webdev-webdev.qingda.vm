  - slide: "/webdev-cr/assets/images/01.OICR-events-gallery1.jpg"
    content: "The purpose of [events.oicr.on.ca](https://events.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} is to promote OICRâ€™s involvement within research communities. OICR Events provides researchers with the important details about OICR events as well as a way to register for them. The backend allows administrators to set up all of the details, forms and email notifications that are necessary for this registration process to occur efficiently."
  - slide: "/webdev-cr/assets/images/02.OICR-Labs-Homepage-gallery2.jpg"
    content: "The purpose of [labs.oicr.on.ca](http://labs.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} is to help OICR labs promote their mission and unique personality, share recent research activities and recruit top talent. The live content editor provides great efficiencies by allowing the teams to keep their information current whenever they like."
  - slide: "/webdev-cr/assets/images/03.OICR-Stein-Lab-gallery3.jpg"
    content: "We work on branding and identity for numerous [OICR labs](http://labs.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} that helps them display their unique personalities. Labs can take ownership of their message and presentation in order to target specific groups of candidates as well as help attract funding."    
  - slide: "/webdev-cr/assets/images/04.OICR-SoftEng-Blog-gallery4.jpg"
    content: "The purpose of [softeng.oicr.on.ca](http://softeng.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} is for the OICR Software Engineering team to publish articles about the impressive tools they are building that empower researchers in their endeavours to elucidate cancer. The blog increases visibility of the team outside of the institute and allows the team to showcase their expertise, cutting-edge technology, groundbreaking tools and upcoming events. It also acts as a recruitment tool; inspiring a technical audience to join the team."
  - slide: "/webdev-cr/assets/images/05.OICR-Institutional-Repository-gallery5.jpg"
    content: "The purpose of [ir.oicr.on.ca is](https://ir.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} to allow OICR researchers to share collections of citations and digital assets. The website is a useful online resource because it encourages author collaboration and file sharing. It also includes a powerful search engine for researchers to find topics and investigators they interest them."
  - slide: "/webdev-cr/assets/images/06.OICR-forms-gallery6.jpg"
    content: "The purpose of [forms.oicr.on.ca](https://forms.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} is to compile important online sign-up forms in one place for OICR employees.  An OICR employee can fill out a form to easily request things such as a CUD group, lab space, jira project or wiki project.  This in turn saves time and ensures that the correct people are notified of requests."
  - slide: "/webdev-cr/assets/images/07.OICR-CUD-gallery7.jpg"
    content: "The purpose of [cud.oicr.on.ca](https://cud.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} is to store the identity (username, password, profile) of OICR employees and their collaborators in one centralized spot and to connect all websites to this single account.  The CUD allows its members to securely log in to a number of connected websites and services with a single account. It allows a group owner to maintain group information and add member accounts to their group, which in turn means less assistance required by the OICR help desk."
